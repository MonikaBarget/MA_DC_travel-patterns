But there are barely a dozen airborne planes in africa right now. Is air travel not risky, in view of covid-19, or is someone selling us a dummy? A 36-year-old woman from cat cay, bimini, is the most recent person to test positive for covid-19 in the bahamas, according to the ministry of health. She has no history of travel and is quarantined at home. #covid19 spreads through physical touch and breathing droplets from an infected person's sneeze, cough or saliva. It is not caused by mosquito bites. No evidence suggests that covid-19 can travel by mosquito bite.

Travel largely continued unabated. Vital public health data from china was not provided or was deemed untrustworthy. A white house riven by rivalries and turnover was slow to act. Nyt: china initially covered up the extent of the sars outbreak and was criticized by health officials around the world for doing so. On thursday the @who praised the chinese response to the new outbreak and said it did not recommend any restrictions on trade or travel to china trump's china travel ban was too little too late and didn't actually do anything to control the flow of infected people, while his european travel ban funneled millions through 13 airports and caused the rampant spread of the virus, #bloodonhishandshannity. Meanwhile: astronauts head to space amid coronavirus pandemic (video) @amy_siskind we know three things about how pottinger reacted in january: he believed information from the ccp was not accurate, thought the virus was worse than being reported, and pushed for a travel ban when the media categorized the approach as counterproductive.

They are blaming trump for something china did. Beyond that, trump banned travel from china as soon as they announced it was an issue in january. Everybody was against it then. I counted every state and territorys index covid case: 13 came from europe vs 5 from china. More than 10,000 direct flights from europe bringing 1,000,000 people flew to us in the 6 weeks before europe travel bans, making prevention in the us impossible who clearly fucked up. Their spokesperson confirmed they didnt rush to issue a travel ban to china in january because they were thinking about the economic impact of the decision on china. And then later #covid_19 fucked up the entire world & perhaps caused a global recession. Coming from the guy who called @realdonaldtrump a "xenophobic fermongerer" for instituting a china travel ban in january due to #covid_19, this is pretty rich... Smh... The president was worried about our safety while you worried about unjustly impeaching him days after ufc 249 was finally postponed, vince mcmahon has deemed that wwe must go on with live shows despite the increased covid-19 risk with wrestlers having to frequently travel back and forth each week. This should not go unnoticed by media. John addresses it in this post. In january news orgs (including the one you work for) were calling it the chinese virus and publishing op eds (including the one you work for) explaining the flu is worse, fear over this virus was all in our minds and warning against ineffective measures like travel bans. #irans rouhani announces the end of #covid19 travel ban despite 26k deaths- who warned that lifting restrictions could lead to a deadly resurgence of the virus. #coronavirus @who @usadarfarsi @statedept @statedeptspox covid-19 travel update: fauci says cruising is ok if you are healthy. - march 9, 2020. ...
