Look at this crazy swarm of commercial flights into & out of the US, Europe and Asia at this very moment. But there are barely a dozen airborne planes in Africa right now. Is air travel not risky, in view of Covid-19, or is someone selling us a dummy?

Life-saving medical equipment was not stockpiled. Travel largely continued unabated. Vital public health data from China was not provided or was deemed untrustworthy. A White House riven by rivalries and turnover was slow to act.
NYT: “China initially covered up the extent of the SARS outbreak and was criticized by health officials around the world for doing so. On Thursday the @WHO praised the Chinese response to the new outbreak and said it did not recommend any restrictions on trade or travel to China”
Trump's China travel ban was too little too late and didn't actually do anything to control the flow of infected people, while his European travel ban funneled millions through 13 airports and caused the rampant spread of the virus, #BloodOnHisHandsHannity. Meanwhile:

How Travel Prepared Me For The Pandemic

Maybe if China didn’t lie about the virus for months we would have known it was an issue earlier. They are blaming Trump for something China did. Beyond that, Trump banned travel from China as soon as they announced it was an issue in January. Everybody was against it then.



I counted every state and territory’s index Covid case: 13 came from Europe vs 5 from China. More than 10,000 direct flights from Europe bringing 1,000,000 people flew to US in the 6 weeks before Europe travel bans, making prevention in the US impossible
WHO clearly fucked up. Their spokesperson confirmed they didn’t rush to issue a travel ban to China in January because they were thinking about the economic impact of the decision on China. And then later #Covid_19 fucked up the entire world & perhaps caused a global recession.





"coming from the guy who called @realDonaldTrump a ""xenophobic fermongerer"" for instituting a China Travel Ban in January due to #Covid_19, this is pretty rich...smh...The President was worried about our safety while you worried about unjustly impeaching him"


Days after UFC 249 was finally postponed, Vince McMahon has deemed that WWE must go on with live shows despite the increased COVID-19 risk with wrestlers having to frequently travel back and forth each week. This should not go unnoticed by media. John addresses it in this post.
In January news orgs (including the one you work for) were calling it the Chinese Virus and publishing op eds (including the one you work for) explaining the flu is worse, fear over this virus was all in our minds and warning against ineffective measures like travel bans.

Henry’s first public statement on COVID-19 was on Jan 25, when ON confirmed first case. Although no cases had been detected in B.C., she was warning health care workers to be vigilant & take a travel history for anyone reporting respiratory symptoms.
The POEA had earlier suspended the deployment of healthcare workers “until the national state of emergency is lifted and until the COVID-19-related travel restrictions are lifted in the destination countries.”

One of the biggest issues in London still surrounds the issue of travel. The cost of living was already making many nurses leave the capital with covid-19 this will now be heightened.

We are in trouble folks, the virus is back in full force in part because people can't do the right thing. It's time to lock back down and stop all air travel, more than anything think more highly of who you choose to socialize with now through the rest of the year. #coronavirus

Here's how, for most of March, Americans continued to travel as normal as the coronavirus spread. It wasn't until March 24 that much of the country shut down — stopping the exponential growth of the virus from overwhelming many parts of the country. http://nyti.ms/2YyocPr

 @MartinSLewis
Nathan, I think its likely due to sparse population and months of little domestic or international travel. The masks most people are wearing aren't stopping the micron level this virus is at. What works: social distancing, frequent hand washing not touch eyes, nose, mouth.

Please explain, Trump defenders, how we’re doing so much worse than the other wealthy nations of the world in dealing with Covid - and how it’s somehow NOT Trump’s fault? They dealt with the same virus we did. Large populations (albeit smaller than ours). Travel from China, etc.
WE ARE TRIPPIN: AAA says Americans will take 700 million trips this summer, despite the virus. They say that's down 15% from last year and the first decline in summer travel in 11 years.

Yes, let’s pay people to travel around the state and spread COVID-19. In the meantime, many are struggling to pay rents, face evictions, and can’t pay for healthcare and hospitalization or food. But they’ll be happy that the wealthier folks will have the freedom to vacation.

Qantas is cutting 6,000 jobs and keeping another 15,000 workers on furlough as it prepares to become a smaller airline after the pandemic. Its fate is tied to Australia re-opening its borders to more international travel - which might not happen until 2021. #F24

Upon finding out in January that there may be a pandemic spreading in China, Trump issued a travel ban which was then contested by the Democrats. That makes them wholly responsible.. Even if he is a piece of shit, this is not what's going on. The media is lying.
No! This is stupid. There’s a lot of people who do not travel at all. Never even left the state they live in. People could actually use the money to get on their feet to get them thru this pandemic. Do better than this. That’s wasting money.

COVID-19 in B.C.: Travel and film industries to restart as British Columbia enters Phase 3 of reopening plan #BChealth #CdnHealth #Cdntravel #BCtravel #BritishColumbia #Vancouver #COVIDCanada #COVIDBC #COVIDVancouver
Non-essential travel and Hollywood North both get the green light, as B.C. enters phase three of the COVID-19 restart plan. As @CityNewsTravis tells us, Premier @jjhorgan is urging people to spend their summer vacation money in B.C. https://citynews1130.com/video/2020/06/24/b-c-enters-phase-3-of-covid-19-restart-plan/… @NEWS1130

This is exactly why Europe Union is considering a ban on US citizens travel, other countries take Covid 19 seriously. The proposed ban is a damning indictment of Trumps handling of the crisis
