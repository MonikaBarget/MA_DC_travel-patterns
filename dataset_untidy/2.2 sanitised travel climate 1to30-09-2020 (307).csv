#HWTR #ClimateChange We know climate change is real and its effects will change how and where we travel. As a travel company reliant on air travel and other forms of transport, we have a responsibility to reduce our emissions and support the transition to a low carbon future.

Newly melted Arctic Sea route saves weeks in travel time + avoids hefty tolls of Suez canal. Russia is benefitting a lot from the warming aspect of climate change. Less fuel for heating used in shortening winters, more farming land available as frozen areas thaw out + new cities

How can anyone still be ignorant of this bs? If masks work then people should still be able to travel wo a “vaccine” but with a mask. I can only conclude this is about tyranny, global warming, and that the virus is fake.
Traveling Locally is being the new trend- #COVID19 helped slow down the global emissions that comes from international travel for a little bit, allowing people to find new solutions to benefit the planet in the future.
By using a virtual studio for an online broadcast, our TEDx is being resource-smart and cutting climate gas emissions from travel, printing and scenography.

Air Travel is 1.9% of global carbon emissions you know. Buildings 39% and road emissions 11.9% ie substantially more. Check out this interactive graph from the World Resources Institute. It might enable you to “wind your neck in” as we say in England

The biggest impact on climate change would be stopping the meat and dairy industries. A vegan world. Not only are they both cruel and barbaric, but they significantly add to emissions. Deforestation and growing feed. Air travel around 2% often CO2 neutral.

This is so important and shows the huge and widespread support for active travel in our country. Don't be fooled by one or two small but well funded road lobbying voices Let's repeat. The majority want safe low traffic roads, reduced air pollution and carbon emissions
I would have thought with lockdown and reduction in (global) travel , emissions would be down--but still higher than average last year
Defenders of air travel will point out that planes account for just 2.8 percent of global carbon emissions, but that number's misleading.

Just as silly to say 'Australia's only 1.9% of global emissions, so why bother!' Massive reductions in air travel help *a lot* in this fight! (also trains are the bloody best)
I loved the opportunity to do the #GlobalTrainingAugust online and therefore without incurring CO2-emissions to travel there! The networking opportunities via table-discussions, regional meetups and speed-networking added inspiring global interactions with fellow trainees.

Some in the aviation industry still don't u/stand. Due to C-19 there has to be less travel around the world but the cuts in flights now only go partly to what the Climate Change/XR/No C02 emissions activists want.
Surface transport accounts for half the decrease in emissions during confinement, and active travel has attributes of social distancing and could help to cut back CO2 emissions & air pollution as confinement is eased. #CMCCForesight http://ow.ly/djkq50BfujQ
