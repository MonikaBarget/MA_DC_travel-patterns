The bicycle is one of the most sustainable methods of travel. Riding a bike for transport, especially to short distance targets are a great way to save energy consumption and contribute to environmental protection. #sustainability #healthylifestyle #Cycling #greenliving #Green
2/ Transportation makes up a HUGE share of our emissions - which is why we need to fundamentally change the way we live, work, travel, and play. Electric vehicles alone are not enough. #ProjectConnect #PropA #ProPropA #YesOnBATX #ClimateAction #TransitNow #ATX #Vote #ATXtraffic
Quite in awe right now after hearing @JaneGoodallInst's talk. What a sweet lady. Feeling really inspired hearing her views on trophy hunting, conservation during the pandemic and how the travel industry needs to be changed. #ecotourism #sustainability
Avoid flying or compensate for the emissions: We should all reduce our amount of flying. You can travel by train. If flying is unavoidable you can use pages like @atmosfair to offset your emissions. #50tips 16/50 #Sustainability #cleanair
