The “Switchblade 600” can probably break tanks, too, so #Ukraine would hit the closer ones w/ NLAW’s & Javelin’s while the rear tanks start getting demolished, too. @aerovironment Probably don’t go back into #Kyiv, #Putin. These missiles can travel up to 90 km to target.
Ban Russia from World Cup, Olympics etc, expulsion from UN committees, travel ban for all government officials, no trade. Every last ruble paid to reconstruct and pay restitution.
