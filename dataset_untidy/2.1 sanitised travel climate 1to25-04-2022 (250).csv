43% of Auckland’s carbon emissions come from private vehicle travel. 72% of Aucklanders believe we need to change how we travel to reduce climate change impacts. Have your say on the Draft Parking Strategy: http://at.govt.nz/parkingstrategy
Thank you ⁦mom (@gibabobbie⁩) for your climate leadership. Took the initiative to offset all travel emissions for all guests at my brother’s wedding yesterday. Love you! Thank you ⁦@cool_effect⁩ for helping with tremendous projects.

Great thread on why just electrifying our vehicle fleet is not enough to combat global warming. We must drive less, which means we need increased possibility for & attractiveness of other travel options (transit, walk, bike, e-bike, e-scooter, etc!). #WeCanDoThis

Taxes on excess consumption, travel (esp. flying and car use), meat, etc ...in fact higher taxes on the most wealthy is an essential component of an effective response to the climate emergency.... The degree of inequality in CO2 emissions is stark
If you truly believe in global warming, abort your children, never drive, never use a mobile phone nor travel on a road or railway

A very odd policy by the Tories Treasury say that the application of an air travel tax for flights in excess of 5,500 miles is to reduce the carbon emissions from aviation 'The Global Britain Tax' sounds like a blow to those businesses engaged in the Global Britain trading mantra

According to the UN World Tourism Organization, the travel and tourism industry produces about 5 percent of all global emissions, which means that the industry plays a key role in the rise, or fall, of greenhouse gas emissions.
Everyone can help limit climate change. From the way we travel, to the electricity we use & the food we eat, we can make a difference. ~2/3 of global greenhouse emissions are linked to private households. Start with these 10 actions #EarthDay #ActNow @UN https://un.org/en/actnow

Coach travel is good for you and the environment. Being a passenger is a stress free way to travel and sharing the journey with others reduces emissions, noise pollution and traffic in built up areas! #coachtravelbenefits #getbackonboard
Good, but there’s just that little matter, mentioned in the article: “Emissions by aircraft while in the air are a big part of the remaining challenge.” No matter how careful an airport is, air travel is currently very far from ‘climate positive’.
