Answer to Why did the US government react slowly to the potential COVID outbreak in the US, but implemented the travel ban very early on? by Cary Mcdonald

Travel (for any reason) outside Canada is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED for residents, fellows and faculty/staff members. If you’ve travelled in last 14 days, report to employee health services and self- monitor for fever, cough, shortness of breath.
