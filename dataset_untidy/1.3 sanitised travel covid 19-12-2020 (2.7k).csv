Lots of antivaxxin’ going on in the comments section, g’damn. It’s like people never heard of how the WHO literally cause the smallpox virus to go extinct through universal vaccination. They had to travel to the most isolated villages in India to get 100%, and it worked.

Now watch how the new improved & faster #Covid_19 variant will spread ALL OVER the UK within days. Why are train companies allowing people to travel in those crowded trains? Who governs this country? #christmasiscancelled #COVIDIOTS
Wow! New covid mutation found in UK & Netherlands yields Dutch Gov't to ban air travel to UK. Not enough is known about the new vaccine research to indicate if human immune system can fight against new SARS-2 Variant
New, more transmissible strain of Covid in London so what do people do when told not to travel? Decide to cram themselves into a train travelling north. I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if there was another year of restrictions thanks to people’s shear ignorance! Fucking twats.

Tens of millions of people are expected to travel to family gatherings or winter vacations over Christmas, despite pleas by public health experts who fear the result could be another surge in COVID-19 cases.
And I’m not sure how often people have to hear “the virus prospers when people gather in close proximity and/or travel” before their reaction ceases to be “sure, but *my* party & the trips there & back are fine, right?” 3/3

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says “postponing travel and staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.”
Why is money wasted on doing this in person during a pandemic? Couldn’t all of that travel money be donated to a food bank or for PPE for health care workers? Zoom works just fine for meetings and it is secure.

Ideally, do NOT travel at all (why are the borders still open?!) BUT if you *absolutely* must travel (ask yourself this), do not spread the virus any further. Spend no unnecessary time at the airport or in nearby communities. Airport staff and local residents need protecting.

I left London today at 10:00am on an empty train. Although against advice, I wanted to travel ahead of the travel window to avoid exactly this and get a covid test on arrival. I thought I was doing the right thing but now being home just feels wrong. There was no winning
“Tier 4 residents must not stay overnight away from home, and cannot travel abroad.” Selfish twat. @JuliaHB1 has undermined attempts to control the virus for months. Now she shows complete disregard for the rules by flying off on holiday. Unbelievable.
Only two new cases of COVID-19 today and both are related to travel outside Atlantic Canada. You can find more information in the news release from the Government of Nova Scotia: https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20201219001…

Like no other event in memory, the #COVID19 pandemic has upended economies in the United States and across the world — transforming how people work, travel, eat, shop and congregate.
U.S. travel is falling out of favour with Canadians, with European and Caribbean destinations being the most sought-after places to travel to post-pandemic.
If you are acting early and decisively @HumzaYousaf, why are you waiting until next Saturday to move the whole of the Scottish mainland into Tier 4? Doesn’t the virus travel too far in a week? Tier 1 to 4 for some - ludicrous. Where’s the evidence?

3. And about taking responsibility, what about Biden taking responsibility for opposing Trump's efforts to cut the influx of COVID to our country by closing off travel to its place of origin? Biden mocked him for that, if you don't recall
New WHO physical activity guidelines highlighting the importance of not only meeting physical activity targets but reducing sedentary behaviours. I'm hopeful that an increase to active travel will be a silver lining of the covid-19 pandemic!

Ugh I do know, but I didn’t think everyone would use that to justify travel at a time when thousands are dying daily of a contagious virus in the middle of a pandemic!
Stuck in tier 3, still, yet infection rates are dropping in Leeds, I can’t travel to York to see my folks but all these people can travel from a hot bed of Covid, by train, to Leeds. Absolute whoppers the lot of them. Tier 4 in two weeks then
Tier 4 Travel restrictions are covered here. Bit of an exodus out of London and SE Tier 4 tonight. Trains, planes and automobiles. Some hiring cars or taxis to flee Tier 4. Everyone needs to help to contain and crush the virus
But don't worry, Leeds they all traveled before Sunday so the virus won't travel with them! such poor planning from SAGE/ the govt

Unionists are more concerned about cross-border travel restrictions than the new Covid strain that's gripped Wales and the south east of England. It's truly remarkable. They'd rather Covid was out of control in all of the UK rather than allow one part to protect itself.

Make sure you aren't traveling to the UK from the US until this is under control. The CDC previously issued a Level 4 Travel Health Notice for the UK. Given how poorly the US reacted to Strain 1, Strain 2 will be far worse if it hits US soil.

MSM should stop the BS: Fauci was wrong on masks, he may have been lying about them which is actually worse. He mocked the idea that travel to hotspots was a problem, wrong on flu vs the novel virus, wrong on airborne. US public health sucks.

Why you should never have to pay for your COVID test. And what to do to make sure you're not charged. If you choose to travel for the holiday, quarantine as long as possible before and for at least 5 days after, and get tested before and after too. Not foolproof but it helps.
 @DavQuinn and @SaturdayRTE
I’ve said it before and i’ll say it again, if people are going to travel, they should have to produce a negative covid test result or the airlines should be checking temperatures before boarding

The safest way to celebrate winter holidays is at home with the people who live with you. Travel and gatherings with family and friends who do not live with you can increase your chances of getting or spreading COVID-19 or the flu. https://cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays/winter.html…
So we can't have voter ID but it's ok limit commerce and travel without an approved phone app confirming your health status... Next will the add confirm your AIDs status?

Please slow down your lifestyle and save lives: - get into a social bubble, - stay home unless, - travel essentially, - stay away from others outside your bubble, - sanitize your hands, - mask mouth and nose, - get out of closed spaces if not ventilated. #Covid_19 #life

Compare to New Zealand who had people in quarantine. Trump's travel restrictions didn't include mandatory testing and quarantine for every traveler, unlike New Zealand. That's why New Zealand's COVID rate is 5 per million and the US is 960 per million.

For one think when you lock down an area then people should have to remain in that area. If you live in lock down area but travel to another area to shop or work it is just spreading the virus. Also lock down should be complete lock down except Hospitals

This COVID assh*le should NOT have been traveling. If I were a passenger on this plane I'd be pissed. But no chance of that as I'm not flying now because if outdoor dining isn't allowed, absolutely no way I believe air travel is safe rn
Xmas day rescues I've been on often had a theme of eager, solo use of new toys - backcountry skis, mtn bikes, etc. Pls stay safe & review the 3T's from @BCAdvSmart. Solo travel in times of COVID-19 may be tempting but is unsafe especially in avalanche terrain
The number of hospitalized COVID patients in the County is increasing at an alarming rate. Please cancel any plans to visit or travel for the holidays. The person most likely to spread COVID to you is not the stranger coughing in a public place, but your friend or relative.
