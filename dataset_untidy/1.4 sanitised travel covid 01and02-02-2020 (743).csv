The reasoning surrounding this was to allow families the space to celebrate the Chinese New Year on Jan. 25 and to evaluate their health if they were returning from overseas travel. But the school assures parents there isn’t a health risk at the school.

Foreign press, perceptions and travel advisories are hard to quickly counter. The same encouragement is now occurring in Australia after the bushfires have subsided, and will be the same in China, when the coronavirus pandemic is under control.

I give this patient lots of credit - immediately went to the hospital. The issue here is with govt - all air travel needs to be suspended right now so that virus is contained to area where it originated.
Hong Kong suffered greatly in 2003. Canada is not cutting entry from China in face of corona virus in favour of screening at airports - an approach consistent with WHO advice. During SARS, with 44 deaths, Canada opposed stopping travel to & from Toronto. What is best approach?

I know there’s a lot going on, but it’s a bit disconcerting that this story has gotten relatively little attention. I can’t help thinking they timed it a) to be overlooked and b) to coincide with restricted travel to China for (ostensibly) health reasons.
disgusting to weaponize the compassion of filipinos against the legitimate call for travel restrictions for health and safety

Safety more important than trade or travel. I think China should focus now only on the deadly virus and it's eradication. WHO should then study and appropriately guide about trade & travel. IMO, WHO has no clue about the virus now. Also eradication important for China citizens.

Coronavirus is not just an Asian issue. Everyone who travels, visits airports, uses public transport, shopping centres or attends community events are potential carriers of this virus. Don't allow the racist among us to capitalise on this. Call out racism when you see it.

This is the time for global cooperation and for people to heed advice from experts in public health. We know #coronavirus #2019nCoV, travel bans, #Brexit are in the news, but let's not forget World Neglected Tropical Diseases Day. These diseases affect 1 billion people. #BeatNTDs

5(tested positive of virus)out of 500, in Wuhan, out of 30,000 total Pakistanis in China are under virtual lock-down quarantine in Wuhan.China hasn't allowed foreigners to travel out. Only US diplomats allowed to fly out of China per Vienna Conventions
It was done to keep this country safe from a deadly virus. The SCOTUS has already ruled that the POTUS has the power and right to ban any or all travel to this country.

Yes, this virus can only be stopped by effective electronic communication. Halting air travel from infected areas will do nothing compared to tweeting happy thoughts.

Seriously, what’s going on with @HHSGov’s #coronarvirus order? What is the scope of the Chinese travel ban? The press release gives no details on what’s authorized, and the order itself literally just says “a public health emergency exists.” https://hhs.gov/about/news/2020/01/31/secretary-azar-declares-public-health-emergency-us-2019-novel-coronavirus.html… #coronarovirus

The World Health Organization just declared that the coronavirus spreading out of China is an international public health emergency. But the WHO does not recommend limiting either trade or travel to China at this time.

Restricting travel can having the opposite effect causing ppl to travel under the radar, avoid reporting sickness, and discouraging the import of needed supplies. China can become less stable which would not be good for public health interventions
The Montana University System is prohibiting all university-related travel to China until further notice. That announcement Friday as world health officials work to contain the spread of the emerging coronavirus outbreak.

Take note of the symptoms of the #nCoV2019 virus (2nd tweet in thread). If you're experiencing these symptoms, call your doctor first, and go see them as soon as possible. In the meantime, wear a mask, wash your hands frequently, and avoid unnecessary travel or crowds.
