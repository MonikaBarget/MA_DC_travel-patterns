How’s that war going that you helped start by coddling Russia and Putin? My travel advice to you- go to Ukraine and see the chaos and damage that came from your work for Trump. Give me your lecture again when you get back.
My friend shared this and I found it helpful to know if you travel abroad and Russia invades the country you’re in, you might need a visa to the new country you evacuate to. Honestly, I didn’t know this and my kid has evacuated twice but she’s American.

Can I just time travel back to 2016 where the 2016 American Election and Brexit was like the most contentious thing everyone was worrying about? I’d take that over Covid and Russia threatening to nuke the west.
Really? How so? You still have many restrictions on who can travel to the U.K. from Ukraine unlike many other European countries. You are #InadvertentlyMisleading us @lucyallan, just as @10DowningStreet and @pritipatel has. Do better and really #LeadTheWay!
Lex, please do not try to travel to Russia or Ukraine right now. Hoping you have not already. If the U.S. closes airspace to Russian flights we may not be able to get you back. We love you. I love the people of Russia as well, just not Putin. He's gone off the deep end.

Most of EU countries closed their airspace to Russian aircraft. Since Russia is expected to retaliate by doing the same to the EU, the two sets of countries will become effectively disconnected from each other in terms of air travel.

How travel is being impacted by the Ukraine invasion
Over the last few days, Putin has lost Russia: • World Cup • Grand Prix • EUFA • Eurovision • Banking exchange w world • Russian soldiers’ lives (about 4,000 so far) • any money he and his clique have stashed abroad • air travel rights over free world • All Street cred
Recently watched Mr Jones (Netflix), which “loosely tells the story of Gareth Jones, a journalist from Wales, who in 1933 travels to the Soviet Union. He uncovers the truth about the #Holodomor, the devastating famine in #Ukraine in which millions died”.
How travel is being impacted by the Ukraine invasion
"Conflict & #space: ""The idea that earthly matters can’t touch something as lofty as space travel is only a platitude, not a certainty. And surely for some spacefaring nations, there must come a point when compartmentalization doesn’t seem like the simple solution it once was."""

Countless governments told their citizens not to travel to Ukraine far back as the 2nd February. On the 6th February, India, who's people make up the largest percentage of foreign students told them to leave. Those not leaving then are at fault themselves!
The foreign secretary should know this, but isn't it illegal to travel abroad to fight in a war that the UK isn't party to? Wasn't that part of the issue with Syria?
Should be interesting as no one goes in or out. They get to relive COVID rules again with no travel. This will be interesting on top of the stop in money transfers. Lets see what #Russia will do now.

This is one of the powerful speeches I’ve ever heard. This is what we call leadership. In a globalized world where people can freely travel and communicate with others across borders, it’s completely absurd to wage a war on a neighbouring country that you share so much with.
Do not travel to Russia due to the security environment and military conflict with Ukraine. If you’re in Russia, consider leaving by private means if it’s safe to do so. Flights between Russia and Europe have been disrupted. Read more:

Yes from same Article Some ppl might have misbehaved (that also not confirmed) & You are making it Ukraine Vs India Why don't you ask Why Student have to travel on its on in most difficult situations After coming out of Ukraine they are practically safe so what did Govt. Do?
So let me get this straight: - Ukrainians with no UK link can’t apply for a visa in Ukraine - if they travel god knows how many miles to a border they can use the points system to apply Screenshot below of the points calc which requires a job offer as mandatory for application.
U.S. citizens departing Ukraine: Poland-Ukraine border crossings remain open, although long waits are reported. Poland has suspended COVID-19 related entry and testing requirements. Have identity, travel documents ready at the time of crossing. More info: https://pl.usembassy.gov/ukraine-information-page/…
Confirmation, after last night’s updated travel advice for Russia, that Ireland is to close its airspace to Russian aircraft @VirginMediaNews
 @Ravalkalpesh_s
@SteveBakerHW, govt link actually backs up that: Ukrainians with no family in the UK are still expected to apply for visas in normal way. No VAC open in #Ukraine, so they need to travel to another country to apply IF they are able. Applying does not = visa granted.

London #Ukraine solidarity rally today: Russian attacks on civilian areas are war crimes. Issue international arrest warrants for Putin & ALL his political allies & military leaders. Freeze their assets & issue travel ban. Block #Russia from Swift banking system & social media!
Cancel Russia from all access to America, trade, vodka, travel, expel all of their diplomats, expel all of their students here, expel all Russian visa holders here working. Facebook, Google and Twitter must isolate all of Putin messaging

Please I need guidelines on how to travel to Ukraine....who has an idea on the opportunity, either education or full immigration.
Ukraine invasion: Russia restricts access to Facebook. All dictators get toppled in the end & normally it’s done internally. Target those around him, take there money, stop there travel & they will turn on the mad Vladputin !!!

Please confirm NOW that you’ll provide safe haven to Ukrainians fleeing a war your government’s complicity has helped to create @pritipatel. Waive the ridiculous obsession with process and allow Ukrainians to travel here without visas. Show some humanity.

”Ukraine – Level 4: Do Not Travel Do not travel to Ukraine due to armed conflict and COVID-19.” Why even mentioning Covid-19!?
The CDC has issued a Level 4 Travel Health Notice for Ukraine, indicating a very high level of COVID-19 in the country. Your risk of contracting COVID-19 and developing severe symptoms is lower if you are fully vaccinated with an FDA authorized vaccine https://ua.usembassy.gov/travel-advisory-ukraine-level-4-do-not-travel-2/…
