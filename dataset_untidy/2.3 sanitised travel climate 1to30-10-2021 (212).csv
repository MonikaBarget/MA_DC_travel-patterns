He needs tweeting of being a Hypocrite Schwarzenegger attacks world leaders over climate policies, arguing that cutting emissions can also boost the economy. What does Arnold drive around in? gas guzzling cars & motorbikes & what does he travel in? jets.
Would like to know how they will have arrived there and what they will do, as it is a global warming meeting. Travel, food, etc. Hypocrisy comes to mind first and foremost.

True, tho travel emissions are still growing. While forecasting long-term relative growth isn't advised given the number of unknowns, this study – https://sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095965261733233X?via%3Dihub… – suggested by 2040, 14% of 2016's total global GHG emissions will come from ICT: a 9x increase on 2007.

Cutting APD for domestic UK flights and freezing fuel duty won’t help tackle climate change or encourage passengers back to the railway. With #COP26 starting next week, now is the time to promote rail travel and start cutting carbon emissions! #Budget2021

The rest of the world is still waiting for #China’s Official plan (NDC) to peak its carbon emissions in the coming years. Without such a plan the credibility of China’s commitment towards climate neutrality is too weak even if the direction of travel is the right one. #COP26
We are proud to say that our entire workforce is climate positive. This means that we offset the carbon footprint of every member of our staff. This includes emissions from their home, personal travel, holidays, food and hobbies, as well as their business travel. #sustainability
Half of global universities that suggest they are committed to taking climate action are yet to set a target date to reach net zero, and many that have set goal are not counting indirect emissions such as travel, reports @elliebothwell https://timeshighereducation.com/news/hundreds-global-universities-yet-toset-netzero-target… #THEClimateImpact

No it’s not great Paul that during a climate crisis the Gov is making it cheaper to fly within the UK. Great would have been the Chancellor showing leadership in tackling the climate crisis and promoting rail over air travel to rapidly decrease our carbon emissions.

Thinking preventing air travel and anything polluting will have an effect on climate change and temperature rise is astonishing. Humans have next-to-zero effect on our planet core. I support reducing emissions to better the air we consume.


If the Conservative Government were serious about reducing our climate emissions they would encourage more people to travel by rail, not price them out. Join me in signing this petition against the rail-fare hike -
“Action on climate change has health co-benefits as measures such as reducing car use through active travel can both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also improve health.” - Professor Gordon Ferns: Head of Department of Medical Education #ClimateChange #ClimateCrisis
Active travel @GlasgowCC style. @COP26 delegates won’t get much use of their free public transport passes. Don’t blame global warming here- it’s neglect as drains are never cleaned.
UK says stuff #cop26 and encourages more people to travel by air, fueling even more emissions Rishi Sunak cuts taxes on domestic flights days before Cop26 #climate summit

"Why ""jet shaming"" is an unproductive tool in the climate debate: it's a small part (2%) of overall CO2 emissions, and there aren't great alternatives. Even if we eliminated all jet travel everywhere, period, it would barely make a dent in overall emissions."


Meanwhile, with TfL's finances stretched to the limit you're wasting £2.2bn of public money on the toxic, carbon-spewing Silvertown Tunnel - money that could be spent on public transport & active travel measures that would reduce pollution & CO2 emissions.
Wait a sec, aren't we supposed to be cutting air travel to reduce GHG emissions? In one story @washingtonpost says there's a climate emergency, then in next story it encourages readers to increase their GHG emissions. @globeandmail does the same

With 63% of global electricity coming from fossil fuels we are a long way from low-carbon electric vehicle (EV) travel (https://ourworldindata.org/electricity-mix). This is in addition to the production emissions, which tend to be higher than for conventional vehicles (e.g. Ellingsen et al 2016)
 @AlexEngVid
The govt has failed to reduce demand for flying & meat-eating in its climate change plans. It has also not shown how to achieve cutting road travel demand & the CCC warns a “techno-centric” approach to cutting emissions has a high risk of failure..
Ahead of @COP26, we carried out research with 5,000 Midlanders 72% of people believe that climate change is the most important issue facing humanity today 8 in 10 are willing change to the way they live and travel to reduce emissions
Comparing apples with oranges? 'Carbon footprint' is not the same as 'total emissions'. BBC Shop Well for the Planet uses Footprint, which includes air travel and cost of overseas manufacturing. Total emissions (used by Climate Change Act/Kyoto) don't. https://buff.ly/3nx9KT1

Westminster and Holyrood's records on rail undermine their climate boasts. Cutting emissions requires a massive shift of journeys from road to rail. That means making rail travel cheap and convenient — investing in services, not cutting them back.

Flight emissions can be some of your biggest pollution contributors. If there are two similar travel paths, then its great for the market to advertise the less polluting one. A growing number of people will admirably pay to offset too

Concern about air travel’s contribution to climate change threatens to curtail growth of an industry that has expanded steadily for decades. The net-zero-emissions-by-2050 target is radical. The proposed technology solutions uncertain.

Travel and sustainability will be major talking points over the next couple of weeks ahead of a major climate change conference, but there are concerns corporations are using carbon offsetting as a cover to avoid taking real action to reduce emissions.
Ministers published a “jet zero” strategy in the summer aimed at reducing emissions from air transport, but it is widely regarded as a more difficult challenge than cutting pollution from car travel or domestic energy.

Aviation is responsible for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, and even more global warming when other greenhouse gas emissions such as nitrogen oxide are taken into account. With air travel increasing, as pandemic measures end, global emissions will increase.
